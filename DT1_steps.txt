three fighters there (roll from the Fighter Table), one at each F. They are
all wounded; roll one die for cach fighter and give him that many hits of
damage. You surprised them, so you have movement initiative for the first
turn. If you attack, go to 24. If you do not attack, but start to run for the
east door, go to 36. If you do not attack, but want to run for the west
door, go to $1. If you want to talk to them, go to 55.

[There is enough for one to drink, either now or later; if you decide
that one of your figures drinks it (at any time not during combat), go to 72 (make a note of that number now), then back to wherever you are
when you drink it.] You may now leave by the east door (132) or the west door (41).

27. If you are walking, cach member of your party moves at n hexes/

33. When you open the chest, spiders jump out. They divide themselves
evenly between everyone within three hexes of the chest and attack
immediately. The spiders have ST one (so any hit will kill them) and  n .
Their MA is n, but they move INTO your hex (that is, ONTO you) and
stay with you wherever you move until you dic or they do.
Their bite does two hits damage, which means that even leather will offer
complete protection unless the spider rolls double or triple damage.
However, shiclds do NOT protect against spider bites.
NOTE: Combat with a spider is considered HTH combat; hit it with
your hand or use a dagger. Since it is HTH, your DX is +n. The spiders
do NOT get a +n. If you ignore your own spiders and hang onto your
weapon, you can use it to strike at spiders on other figures (NOT on
yourself). Hope you hit the spiders and not your friends. . .
If anyone is still alive after you deal with the spiders (and you'd better
be . . . things are just beginning to warm up) you find four gold bars in the
bottom of the chest. You can now go out the west door (16). Don't bother
trying the east door; it is locked behind you and will remain so.

34. The first one to make it through the door gets through. No one else
can. Go back to 3, and don't try the near door again. The one who escaped
can't come back until the orcs are dead OR no live humans are left in the

the west), WALK toward the other door at three hexes per turn (27), RUN for
the other side at full MA (14), attack the statue at X (54), attack the statue
at Y (98), attack the statue at Z (120), attack more than one of the statues
on the same turn (64), or just stand there and wait (129). Careful. These
decisions can kill you.

48. You are in the Red Room (a standard MELEE map with no
obstacles). There is a large chest in the exact center of the room. You may
open it (93) or go out the west door (16). The east door is now locked.

49. Anyone who tries to leave by the west door succeeds, but can't
get back in until only one side is left in the room — that is, until either the
orcs are dead or the party is all dead or out. Escapees are now at 143.

50. The bears are exactly as given in MELEE/WIZARD. They will fight
to the death and not retreat; other than that, they may use any tactics. If

go to 94, If anyone tries to go out the near door, go to 35S. If you kill the
bears, go to 117.

51. You are now at 45. They do not follow.

to act comes, he (obviously) does nothing. Otherwise, he fires a lightning
bolt at the most threatening member of your party. His ST started at 10.
He fires a n-die bolt (or, if you hurt him, the strongest bolt he can throw
without losing consciousness). If he survives the first round, his action on
the second round will be to teleport away. If you kill him before he can
vanish, you will find six jewels on his body. Otherwise, you find nothing in
the room. You may leave by the east door (132) or the west door (41).

for sure. You can fight (66), run out the door you came in (148), or stand
still (122).

59. Anyone going into the pit is fried instantly. Everything that that
figure was carrying is lost. Go back to 67 and continue.

at A and B. If you have one or two members in your party, go to 68. If

62. Place your figures on the entrance hexes and go to 161.

damage you do - and then go to 81.

go out the way you came (87 if from the east, 112 if from the west).

66. There are three fighters (roll from the Fighter Table) and one
wizard; if you are using MELEE only, there are four fighters. If there is a
wizard, he has . He knows the first 10 spells in the
Spell Table. If your FIRST choice was to fight, you have the initiative for
the first move; otherwise, they do. If you kill them all, go to 158. If at any
time you try to leave by either door, go to 74. If you surrender, go to 107.

67. They fire at you. Each has , a small bow and 
daggers. They will use the bows as long as they can, firing twice per turn
since their DX is . They have no armor. If anyone moves into the pit, or
is forced into it by a retreat, go to 59. If you kill the archers, go to 136. If
you run out an exit, go to 123.

68. When they see you, they shout  You can attack anyway
(go to 76) or stop to see what they have to say (141).

he gets out alive, he will recover in time, but his basic ST will be five points
lower. If he is a foe, he attacks you. Go back to wherever you came from.

78. Move each of your characters five hexes and go to 161.

79. Anyone who gets past the goblins and out the far door IS out of the
room. He cannot return, though, until all the goblins are dead or the rest of
the party is out of the room and/or slain. If the "far" door was the west
one, you are at 7. If it was the east one, you are at 31.

will not return. Go back to 24.

81. If one of the statues you attacked was Y, and you hit it, go to 109.

You had better fight it (157) or run for an exit (162). One turn passes
while you waste time.

that figure has taken, whichever is less. Return to wherever you came from.

105. You now have two swordbrothers to help you. Get two fighters
from the Fighter Table. They meant their offer; they will be loyal to you.
You had better be loyal, too. If you stab them, send them into combat and
run, or otherwise take advantage of them, the Thorsz will see it, and you
will have a messy death in store for you if you get out of here. Go to 149.
By the way, one of them has one jewel.

106. Whoever went in FIRST is fried. All that that figure was carrying
is lost. The rest of you hear the scream and stay out. Go to 136.

108. You're out. If you left by the west exit, you're at 112. If you left
by the east exit, you're at 87.

109. Statue Y gives a grating roar. It is a Gargoyle, exactly as described
in MELEE/WIZARD. It didn't think you'd spot it. Its skin stops n hits/
attack; if you put more hits than that on it, it's hurt. On the next turn, it
will attack; if possible, it will take to the air and dive on one of your
figures to attempt HTH combat. You can all help fight it (157), leave the
gargoyle his prey and run for either door (162), or stand around and watch
the other statues (82).

110. Combat occurs normally. The four fighters will divide themselves
as evenly as possible among the members of your party. If any of them

any), your missile-weapon users, or whoever they can hit. You HAVE to
fight (at least until you get a chance to run). Go to 97.

111. You are facing east. You walk cast and turn south. You come toa

(84), cast (6), or west (88).

117. Examining the room, you see a large ring in the floor. It will
take everyone's strength combined to pull it up, as you find by careful
experimentation. Do you lift the trapdoor, or just leave? If you lift it,
group your party around hex T on the map (at number 11) and then go
to 83. If you go out the east door, go to 100. If you go west, go to 18.

118. Anyone who steps out the east door may leave, and freely reenter.
You are at 8. The enemy will not follow you out.

119. Tough luck. They're attacking. The enemy gets one free turn,
during which you may do NOTHING. If any of them had missile weapons
ready, they fire at you. If any had missile weapons that were not ready,
they ready them. Go to 110.

120. Roll one die. On a n, go back to 38 and try something else;
otherwise, go to 135.

121. They will fight; their favorite tactic is to throw their ready ax at
a figure other than the onc they were engaged with. If you kill them all, go
to 147. If anyone makes it to the far side, go to 108. If anyone breaks and
runs for the way your group entered, go to 138.

122. You stood still and lost the initiative. They move to attack you.
On your move, you can run for the entry (74) or fight (66).

123. You escape. You are at 154 (if you came from the east) or 9 (if
you came from the west). However, those arrows can pass through the
curtain (yours can't, so don't try). Roll one die for cach of your figures.
On a n, one arrow (1 — 1) hit him. Ona n, two hit. Now run, you cowards.

124. They attack immediately. Go to 76.

125. He had one jewel and one flask of potion. The tag says "Drink, or
give to one who can drink no longer." You can, at any time, have one
figure drink it (104) or pour it down the throat of a corpse (77). Make
note of these numbers; you can go to one of them at any time you are not
actually in combat. There is only enough potion for one figure. When you
do use the potion, save your place then so you can return to it. If you do
not drink the potion right now, you may leave by either exit (69).

126. You are in the Violet Room. It seems to be completely empty.
You may stand still (62), walk across at n hexes/ turn (78), run across at
full MA (139), or turn around to leave (150).

127. Each of the goblins has . If you are playing
WIZARD rules, two are wizards; otherwise all are fighters. Wizards have the
8 IQ spells, a staff, and two daggers each; fighters have short bows and two
daggers each. If you kill them, go to 102. If you run to the far exit, go to 79. If you turn to leave, go to 63.

128. The sword is magic. It has  n  even when its user has a worse
DX, and does three dice damage.

129. Roll one dic. On a n, go to 135. On any other number, nothing
happens. You can stand still another turn (142) or go back to 38.

130. Anyone who heads for the west door can step through. He can
teenter at any time. He is at 45.

131. You are facing west. There is a curtain in front of you. Step
through (60) or turn around (90).

132. You are facing cast: walk east (155) or turn around (166).

133. You are facing east; in front of you is a curtain. Go through (57)
or turn around (112).

134. If one fighter escapes, he's gone. Keep fighting the other onc; go
back to 76. If both escape, the fight is over. Go to 149,

135. You see Statue Y move slightly. Then, incredibly quickly, it
unfolds leathery wings and leaps into the air. It comes flapping toward the
member of your party with the lightest armor — or the closest one, if more
than one are equally unprotected. Before you can react, it lands on that
person (its MA in the air on the turn it takes off is n, and it had initiative)
to attempt HTH combat. It is, in fact, your standard Gargoyle, straight out
of MELEE/WIZARD, and it is trying to smash one of your people. You
can all join the fight (157), leave the gargoyle's victim behind and run for
the door (162), or stand around for one turn while the fight goes on,
watching the other statues for signs of life (82).

136. Each enemy you loot had one jewel. You may now leave by the
east door (154), the west door (9), or by jumping into the pit (59). You
must leave this room ONE AT A TIME, so line up in the order you want
to leave in, whichever way you go.

137. Go to 56.

138. Refusing a challenge from hobgoblins? How cowardly. The curtain
does not let you pass, as you find out by running into it. You are still in
the entry hex(es), with your face(s) to the wall. Go back to 121 and fight,
or die groveling.

139. Each of your figures makes one move at his/her full MA. Place
them wherever they went, and go to 161.

140. The wolves are as in MELEE/WIZARD. They ALL attack the same
person. This will be the lightest-armored one, or the one who has taken the
most wounds; it's up to the wolves. They fight until you all run (69), kill
them all (151), or die.

141. One of them says: "We lost our two friends. Since groups of up to
four are allowed, shall we join forces? We will give oath to be swordbrothers,
if you will do the same." You can accept their offer and swear
(105), or refuse and fight (76).

142. Go to 129 again.

143. You are facing west. You go west and come toa curtain. You can
go through (13) or turn around (155).

144. You are facing west. In front of you is a curtain. Go through (11)
or turn around (100).

145. You are facing west. There is a curtain in front of you. Go forward
(71) or turn around (31).

146. You are facing west. A stairway leads up. You may take it (23) or
turn around (30).

147. There were two gold bars behind a rock. You can go out the east
door (87) or the west door (112).

148. Roll for initiative. If the enemy wins, they attack you; go to 66. If
you win, you may run back for the door you entered; go to 74.

149. You can freely leave (and go back, if you wish). If you stepped
out the east door, you're at 90. If it was the west Joor, you're at 46. If you
were pursued, don't worry; nothing is chasing you.

150. You bounce. Go back to 126.

151. There is a dead body lying in one corner of the room. You can
designate one or more figures to search it (pick which ones, and go to 125),
or leave by either exit (69).

152. The ring is a "blur ring." It reduces the DX of all attacks against
its wearer by 4.

153. Gargoyles are tough, aren't they? The "pedestal" he was sitting on
is actually a chest. If you open it, place the characters who do so around Y
and go to 15. If you leave it alone and head for the exit, go to 162.

154. You are facing east. Go forward (91) or turn around (114).

155. You are facing east. In front of you is a curtain. Go through (3) or
turn around (143).

156. You are facing west. In front of you is a curtain. Go through (126)
or turn around (92).

157. You fight the gargoyle. If you kill it, go to 153. If some or all of
you try to run, go to 162 upon attempting to step through either door.

158. There were four gold bars in the room. Searching the bodies, you find three jewels and a flask of potion. Any one of your figures can drink it, either
now or at any time he/she is not actually in combat. When the potion is
drunk, go to 137 (make a note of that number now). When you go to 137,
keep your finger on your place, because 137 cannot direct you back. You
can now leave by the east (43) or west (85) exit.

159. You are in the Black Room (see map below). The only illumination
is provided by flickering torches. You see four figures standing in line
(Ms on map). Arrange your figures on the entry hexes and go to 58.

160. Nothing happens. Go back to wherever you came from.

161. A giant appears. He is as described in MELEE/WIZARD, with  and a club that does three + three damage when it hits. Play the giant
according to the WIZARD rules if you have them. The giant appears in
triangle one (see map at 38) UNLESS you have a figure in one of those hexes.
In that case, he appears in (order of preference) triangle two three or fouur. If you
have figures in all these, the giant appears in four anyway, putting 10 hits on
any figure in that triangle and knocking it down underneath him. You have
initiative. If you run for an exit, go to 70. If you attack, play out the combat, going to 70 if someone tries to use an exit and 103 if you kill him.

162. You made it to an exit? Excellent! You may walk on out. If you
hear a scream behind you (as of another member of your party getting
seriously damaged), you can go back. It might not be smart, though. You
are at 40 if you went out the west exit, or 28 if you took the east one.

163. Every wolf that you engage on YOUR move will stay and fight the
one(s) who engaged it. The others will do as in 140. Go to 140.

164. One of them had a jewel. Go to 149.

165. That figure dies. Go back where you came from.

166. You are facing west. In front of you is a curtain. Go through (13)
or turn around (155).

167. The officer figures your group's score as follows: For each giant or
bear killed, points. For each gargoyle,  points, For each experienced
